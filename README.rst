Pi MusicBox
*********************

Operate Spotify from your couch with this ready to eat Music Box software for the Raspberry Pi. 

A lot of people have problems getting the Pi to work as a Spotify-player. This bootable image makes it a lot easier. As a bonus, it includes AirTunes support.

Features

Working Spotify server based on Mopidy, to use with a nice browser-interface, or with an MPD-client 
AirTunes streaming
No need for tinkering, no need to setup things in the Linux commandline 
USB Audio support (Soundcard, speakers, headphones). The analog port works very well, but with an external USB soundcard it's of better quality. 
Wifi support (WPA, if the kernel supports your wifi-adapter)
It's also a great way to get started with tinkering. It can e.g. be modified to play local music-files, but it's not enabled at the moment.
