		<h2>Pi MusicBox</h2>
		<p>
			Operate Spotify from your couch with this ready to eat Music Box software for the Raspberry Pi. 
			<br/><br/>A lot of people have
			problems getting the Pi to work as a Spotify-player. This bootable image makes it a lot
			easier. As a bonus, it includes AirTunes support.
		</p>

		<h3> Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Working Spotify server based on Mopidy, to use with a nice
				browser-interface, or with an MPD-client
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				AirTunes streaming
			</li>
			<li>
				No need for tinkering, no need to setup things in the Linux
				commandline
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				USB Audio support (Soundcard, speakers, headphones). The analog port
				works very well, but with an external USB soundcard it's of better
				quality.
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Wifi support (WPA, if the kernel supports your wifi-adapter)
			</li>
			<li>
				It's also a great way to get started with tinkering. It can e.g. be modified to play local music-files, but it's not enabled at the moment.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Requirements </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Working Raspberry Pi 
			</li>
			<li>
				Speakers/amplifier
			</li>
			<li>
				SD Card, 2GB minimum (tested on a 4GB model. It can probably run on a
				1GB, but then you need to resize the partitions)
			</li>
			<li>
				Computer with a modern browser; tablet or phone. The webinterface is tested with
				recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and iOS (iPad/iPhone). It could also work with IE10
				and other modern mobile browsers (Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile). You can also use an 
				<a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients">MPD client</a> to connect.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spotify Premium account for streaming.			
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Alpha</h3>
		<p>
			Please regard this image as alpha-quality. It's quite stable, but
			don't cry if things go wrong...
		</p>
		<h3> Instructions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Download the <a href="musicbox.zip" title="musicbox.zip">image
				here</a>. It's around 1G in (compressed) size; 4G uncompressed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Extract the zip-file. Put the resulting image on your SD Card by following <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">these
				instuctions</a>. The image is for a 4GB card, but you can put it on a
				2GB one, using
				<code>
					dd
				</code> in OS X/Linux. It gives an error because
				the image is too big, but that's no problem because it's empty space.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you're on Windows, download an editor which supports Unix editing.
				E.g. <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>
				or <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
				. Users of Os X and Linux can edit the file directly.
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Open the contents of the 'config' folder of SD Card in your
				Finder/Explorer.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add your credentials of your Spotify Premium account to the file
				<code>
					settings.py
				</code>, 
				using the text editor you downloaded.
			</li>
			<li>
				Optional (if you have a Wifi-adapter): edit
				<code>
					wpa_supplicant.conf
				</code>
				for your Wifi
				credentials if you want Wifi (WPA security only)
			</li>
			<li>
				Put the card in the Pi
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Connect cables (You don't have to connect a screen to the Pi if you
				don't want to)
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Turn on Pi
			</li>
			<li>
				Wait for a while
			</li>
			<li>
				Point your browser to the Pi. Depending on your network and computers,
				you could try this address:
				<code>
					http://musicbox.local/
				</code>
			</li>
			<li>
				Most OS X/iOS devices probably will find it, but Windows machines
				without iTunes installed, won't. If it doesn't work, you could try to
				install Apple Bonjour (comes with iTunes) to make it work.
			</li>
			<li>
				Otherwise try to find out the IP-address of your Pi and point the
				browser to that address. The IP-address is printed on the screen when
				MusicBox is started. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The service is announced as Avahi/Bonjour/Zeroconf, so you should be
				able to find the ip/service via Safari or e.g. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/dnssd/">this
				extension for Firefox</a>
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				To use Wifi and USB-Audio you have to plugin the devices before you
				start the Pi. Restart if you plug them in later.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 style="color: red"> SECURITY WARNING</h3>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			This is system not secure at all. Don't run it outside a firewall!!
			<br />
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The Mopidy musicserver is not protected, and the Musicbox services are
				run as root. Maybe this is better in the future, but not now. Sorry.
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Also, the passwords of Spotify and wifi are stored in plain text on
				the SD card. 
			</li>
			<li>
				You can SSH to the server with the <strong>root</strong> login and
				the password <strong>musicbox</strong>.
			</li>
		</ul>
