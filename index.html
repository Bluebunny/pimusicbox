        <h2>Pi MusicBox</h2>
        <p>
            Operate Spotify from your couch with this ready to eat Music Box software for the Raspberry Pi.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A lot of people have problems getting the Pi to work as a Spotify-player. This bootable image makes it a lot
            easier. As a bonus, it includes AirTunes support.
        </p>

        <h3> Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Working Spotify server based on Mopidy, to use with a nice
                browser-interface, or with an MPD-client
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                AirTunes streaming
            </li>
            <li>
                No need for tinkering, no need to use the Linux
                commandline
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                USB Audio support (Soundcard, speakers, headphones). The analog port
                works, but the quality of the port is not great. It also has some noise between tracks (might be fixed in the future).
                I would recommend an external USB soundcard for better sound quality.
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Wifi support (WPA, if the kernel supports your wifi-adapter)
            </li>
            <li>
                It's also a great way to get started with tinkering. It can e.g. be modified to play local music-files, but it's not enabled at the moment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Requirements </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Working Raspberry Pi 
            </li>
            <li>
                Speakers/amplifier
            </li>
            <li>
                SD Card, 2GB minimum (tested on a 4GB model. It can probably run on a
                1GB, but then you need to resize the partitions)
            </li>
            <li>
                Computer with a modern browser; tablet or phone. The webinterface is tested with
                recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and iOS (iPad/iPhone). It could also work with IE10
                and other modern mobile browsers (Chrome Mobile, Firefox Mobile). You can also use an
                <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients">MPD client</a> to connect.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spotify Premium account for streaming.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Beta</h3>
        <p>
            Please regard this image as beta-quality. It's quite stable, but
            don't cry if things go wrong...
            <ul>
                <li>
                    v0.2: New, much nicer web-interface
                </li>
                <li>
                    v0.2: Based on Raspbian (Moebius) for better performance and stability
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3> Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Download the <a href="musicbox0.2.zip">image
                here</a>. It's around 700MB in (compressed) size; 2GB uncompressed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract the zip-file. Put the resulting image on your SD Card by following <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Easy_way">these
                instuctions</a>. The image is for a 2GB card, but you can put it on a
                larger one. It could even fit on a 1GB card, but that needs some work.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're on Windows, download an editor which supports Unix editing.
                E.g. <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>
                or <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
                . Users of Os X and Linux can edit the file directly.
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Open the contents of the 'config' folder of SD Card in your
                Finder/Explorer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your credentials of your Spotify Premium account to the file
                <code>
                    settings.py
                </code>,
                using the text editor you downloaded.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional (if you have a Wifi-adapter): edit
                <code>
                    wpa.conf
                </code>
                for your Wifi
                credentials if you want Wifi (WPA security only)
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the card in the Pi
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Connect cables (You don't have to connect a screen to the Pi if you
                don't want to)
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn on Pi
            </li>
            <li>
                Wait for a while
            </li>
            <li>
                Point your browser to the Pi. Depending on your network and computers,
                you could try this address:
                <code>
                    http://musicbox.local/
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Most OS X/iOS devices probably will find it immediately. Windows machines
                without iTunes installed, won't. If it doesn't work, you could try to
                install Apple Bonjour (comes with iTunes) to make it work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Otherwise try to find out the IP-address of your Pi and point the
                browser to that address. The IP-address is printed on the screen when
                MusicBox is started. Connect a monitor/tv to find out.
            </li>
            <li>
                The service is announced as Avahi/Bonjour/Zeroconf, so you should be
                able to find the ip/service via Safari or e.g. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/dnssd/">this
                extension for Firefox</a>
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                To use Wifi and USB-Audio you have to plugin the devices before you
                start the Pi. Restart if you plug them in later.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: red"> SECURITY WARNING</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            This is system not secure at all. Don't run it outside a firewall!! When I find the time, I will fix it.
            <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Mopidy musicserver is not protected, and the Musicbox services are
                run as root. Maybe this is better in the future, but not now. Sorry.
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                Also, the passwords of Spotify and wifi are stored in plain text on
                the SD card. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You can SSH to the server with the <strong>root</strong> login and
                the password <strong>musicbox</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>
